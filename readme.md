A Small and in a very initial state emulator of the windows **Internet Download Manager** Browser Integration service to the linux.

### Why?
Well, this a try to make the **IDM** under wine be able to catch the native host system download in the browser.

### Current State:
Currently the "Emulator" only handle one type of message from the **IDM Integration Module**, and you be able to see his effect by **Rigth click -> Download with IDM** button.
